# Attributes


- Let's start with a text input tag. There are several types of inputs that we discussed in the previous section: text, color, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. How can the browser tell which is meant to be what? HTML attributes! Attributes are additional pieces of information that you can attach to HTML tags. We're going to use the type attribute to pass that to the browser.

``` <input type="checkbox" /> ```

``` <input type="color" /> ```

``` <input type="file" />```




# ID vs Classes

# Namig and Semantics
- You generally want to give things useful names. There's a saying in computer science that there are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. (Cache invalidation is another topic for another day.) So if you struggle to come up with names for things like classes and IDs, you're not alone. As a programmer you get to name a lot of things.

- Generally, with classes, you want to name things semantically. This is a fancy word (often used when talking about HTML) that you want use tags and name things as close to what thing is and not what it looks like
