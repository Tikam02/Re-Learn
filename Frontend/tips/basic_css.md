# Basics

## Parents and Children


```html
<div>
  <h1>An h1</h1>
</div>
```

- And I have CSS that looks like this:

```html
div {
  color: blue;
}
```

- The h1 will be colored blue. This is because it has a parent (or ancestor) tag that is a div which means that CSS will still affect it. This even works will large degrees of separation.
