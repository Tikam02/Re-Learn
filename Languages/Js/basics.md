# Basics

## Introduction

### Functions

- Code we save ('define') functions & can use (call/invoke/execute/run) later with the function's name & ()

### Execution Context

- created to run the code of a function - has 2 parts - Thread of execution and Memory

### Call Stack

- Javascript keep track of what function is currently running.(Where's the thread of execution)

- Run a function - add to call stack

- Finish running the function - JS removes it from call stack.

- Whatever is top of the call stack - that's the function we're currently running.
